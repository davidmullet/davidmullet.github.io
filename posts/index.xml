      <description>Books: &amp;lsquo;The Why Is Everything: A Story of Football, Rivalry, and Revolution&amp;rsquo; by Michael Silver I just finished reading The Why Is Everything: A Story of Football, Rivalry, and Revolution by Michael Silver.&#xA;Silver is a sportswriter currently writing for The Athletic and has previously written for Sports Illustrated and the San Francisco Chronicle, among others.&#xA;In The Why Is Everything, Silver documents the rise of a young generation of NFL coaches, many of whom started or developed under long-time NFL head coach Mike Shanahan.</description>

      <title>Books: &#39;Safe Houses&#39; by Dan Fesperman</title>

      <description>Books: &amp;lsquo;Safe Houses&amp;rsquo; by Dan Fesperman In another post, I mentioned that most main characters in espionage stories are either professional spies or unwitting amateurs. That article highlighted the failed professionals of Mick Herron&amp;rsquo;s Slow Horses / Slough House series, who fall somewhat in between.&#xA;In Dan Fesperman&amp;rsquo;s Safe Houses, Helen Abell falls into this gap, as well, but from a different angle. Helen works on the fringe of the espionage business, managing safe houses for the CIA in 1979 Berlin.</description>

      <description>The Slow Horses of Slough House Many espionage stories&amp;rsquo; protagonists fall into one of two categories&amp;hellip;&#xA;The first category is the espionage professional: Ian Fleming&amp;rsquo;s James Bond, Daniel Silva&amp;rsquo;s Gabriel Allon, and John LeCarre&amp;rsquo;s George Smiley all come to mind. Cool, calm, collected, they are trained and paid to do their nation&amp;rsquo;s dirty work.&#xA;At the other end of the spectrum is the unwitting amateur that finds themselves thrust into a situation which they are seemingly ill-equipped to deal with.</description>

      <description>Books: &amp;lsquo;How We Got to Now: Six Innovations That Made the Modern World&amp;rsquo; by Steven Johnson I just finished reading How We Got to Now: Six Innovations That Made the Modern World by Steven Johnson, and I enjoyed it quite a bit.&#xA;Goodreads rates it at 4.11 and I would say that is about right, if you enjoy history and science.&#xA;Read more&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Books: &amp;lsquo;Bad Debts&amp;rsquo; by Peter Temple I first stumbled across Jack Irish on Acorn TV. It was (or should I say &amp;lsquo;is&amp;rsquo;, in today&amp;rsquo;s perpetual-life-via-streaming world?) an Australian TV series (and movies) starring Guy Pearce (LA Confidential, Memento, The King&amp;rsquo;s Speech). I enjoyed the TV series very much and recently sought out Peter Temple&amp;rsquo;s novels, on which the TV series is based.&#xA;Read more&amp;hellip;</description>
