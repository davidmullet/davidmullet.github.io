      <description>Books: &amp;ldquo;The Drowned&amp;rdquo; I just finished reading The Drowned by John Banville.&#xA;This is the latest in the series of Irish mystery novels featuring Dublin pathologist Quirke and police inspector Strafford. Banville’s first seven Quirke novels were published under the pseudonym Benjamin Black. Some of these earlier stories, such as Christine Falls, were made into movies starring Gabriel Byrne.&#xA;Read on Medium&amp;hellip;&#xA;Read on Substack&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Books: &amp;ldquo;The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club&amp;rdquo; I recently finished reading The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club by Dorothy L. Sayers. Published in 1928, this is the fifth book featuring Sayers&amp;rsquo; famous amateur detective Lord Peter Wimsey. Martin Edwards makes many mentions of Ayers in his history of mystery writing, The Life of Crime, which I recently enjoyed. So I thought I should at least give it a go.&#xA;Read more&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Books: &amp;lsquo;The Life of Crime&amp;rsquo; by Martin Edwards I just finished reading The Life of Crime: Detecting the History of Mysteries and their Creators by Martin Edwards.&#xA;This 2022 release is a 622-page comprehensive history of mystery writing, from the eighteenth century to the present. Each chapter contains numerous footnotes, and the book includes a bibliography and two indexes at the back: an Index of Titles and an Index of Names.</description>

      <description>Books: &amp;lsquo;Karla&amp;rsquo;s Choice&amp;rsquo; by Nick Harkaway I just finished reading Karla&amp;rsquo;s Choice by Nick Harkaway.&#xA;The cover identifies this as &amp;ldquo;A John Le Carré Novel&amp;rdquo;, though Le Carré — who passed away in 2020 — did not write it. Harkaway, an established novelist in his own right, is also the son of the late spy novelist John Le Carré. Karla&amp;rsquo;s Choice is set in the world of British agent George Smiley — the world that Le Carré created — and slots in between The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1963) and The Looking Glass War (1965).</description>

      <description>Books: &amp;lsquo;Broken Trust: A Spenser Novel&amp;rsquo; by Mike Lupica I recently finished reading Broken Trust by Mike Lupica, the 50th title in the Spenser series. A little background…&#xA;Robert B. Parker created Boston private detective Spenser (&amp;ldquo;no first name&amp;rdquo;) in 1973 with The Godwulf Manuscript and continued through Sixkill, published posthumously in 2011. Sixkill was the 39th Spenser novel. Along the way (1985–1988), there was a Spenser: For Hire TV series starring Robert Urich.</description>

      <description>In the Beginning, There Was Motown&amp;hellip; We recently attended a Motown tribute concert, and I was struck by the fact that many songs that I had long associated with post-Motown artists were originally Motown hits many years before.

      <description>The Incomparable Ricky Jay I think I first encountered Ricky Jay in David Mamet&amp;rsquo;s House of Games with Joe Mantegna and Lindsay Crouse. He would pop up now and again over the years in films and TV episodes, including the final season of Sneaky Pete, his last on-screen work. I enjoyed his crafty, cynical, world-weary con men wherever they made an appearance&amp;hellip;&#xA;Read more&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Books: &amp;lsquo;The Wrong Hands&amp;rsquo; by Mark Billingham I was browsing the New Releases shelves at one of my local libraries (we have library cards for three local systems) when I stumbled upon The Wrong Hands by Mark Billingham. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t familiar with this British author but he has a long-running series of books featuring an inspector Tom Thorne.&#xA;The Wrong Hands is the second book in a different series featuring detective Declan Miller.</description>

The series was written and initially published in Italian, but I read the English translation by Antony Shugaar.&#xA;Read more&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Books: &amp;lsquo;Safe Houses&amp;rsquo; by Dan Fesperman In another post, I mentioned that most main characters in espionage stories are either professional spies or unwitting amateurs. That article highlighted the failed professionals of Mick Herron&amp;rsquo;s Slow Horses / Slough House series, who fall somewhat in between.&#xA;In Dan Fesperman&amp;rsquo;s Safe Houses, Helen Abell falls into this gap, as well, but from a different angle. Helen works on the fringe of the espionage business, managing safe houses for the CIA in 1979 Berlin.</description>

      <description>The Slow Horses of Slough House Many espionage stories&amp;rsquo; protagonists fall into one of two categories&amp;hellip;&#xA;The first category is the espionage professional: Ian Fleming&amp;rsquo;s James Bond, Daniel Silva&amp;rsquo;s Gabriel Allon, and John LeCarre&amp;rsquo;s George Smiley all come to mind. Cool, calm, collected, they are trained and paid to do their nation&amp;rsquo;s dirty work.&#xA;At the other end of the spectrum is the unwitting amateur that finds themselves thrust into a situation which they are seemingly ill-equipped to deal with.</description>

      <description>Books: &amp;lsquo;Bad Debts&amp;rsquo; by Peter Temple I first stumbled across Jack Irish on Acorn TV. It was (or should I say &amp;lsquo;is&amp;rsquo;, in today&amp;rsquo;s perpetual-life-via-streaming world?) an Australian TV series (and movies) starring Guy Pearce (LA Confidential, Memento, The King&amp;rsquo;s Speech). I enjoyed the TV series very much and recently sought out Peter Temple&amp;rsquo;s novels, on which the TV series is based.&#xA;Read more&amp;hellip;</description>
