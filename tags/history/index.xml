      <description>Books: &amp;ldquo;Precipice&amp;rdquo; I recently finished reading Precipice by Robert Harris.&#xA;I have read several of Harris&amp;rsquo; novels, including The Fear Index, Second Sleep, An Officer and a Spy, and Conclave, which was recently made into an Oscar-nominated movie.&#xA;Like An Officer and a Spy, which was about the Dreyfus Affair, Precipice is a work of fiction based on actual historical events.&#xA;Read on Medium&amp;hellip;&#xA;Read on Substack&amp;hellip;</description>
