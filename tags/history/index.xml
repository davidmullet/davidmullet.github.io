      <description>Books: &amp;ldquo;The Ghosts of Rome&amp;rdquo; I recently finished reading The Ghosts of Rome by Joseph O&amp;rsquo;Connor.&#xA;This is the sequel to 2023&amp;rsquo;s My Father&amp;rsquo;s House, continuing the story of the Rome Escape Line, which helped escaped POWs remain in hiding or safely flee Italy altogether. Most of the major characters from the first book return in this one, but while the first book revolved around Monsignor Hugh O&amp;rsquo;Flaherty, this book revolves more around another of O&amp;rsquo;Flaherty&amp;rsquo;s Escape Line cohorts (aka &amp;lsquo;The Choir&amp;rsquo;), Contessa Giovanna &amp;lsquo;Jo&amp;rsquo; Landini&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Books: &amp;ldquo;Precipice&amp;rdquo; I recently finished reading Precipice by Robert Harris.&#xA;I have read several of Harris&amp;rsquo; novels, including The Fear Index, Second Sleep, An Officer and a Spy, and Conclave, which was recently made into an Oscar-nominated movie.&#xA;Like An Officer and a Spy, which was about the Dreyfus Affair, Precipice is a work of fiction based on actual historical events.&#xA;Read on Medium&amp;hellip;&#xA;Read on Substack&amp;hellip;</description>
