      <description>Books: Break In I recently decided to revisit the mysteries of Dick Francis, many of which I had read in the 1990s, and found Break In at my local library. I remembered none of the details from my first reading so the story was essentially new to me.&#xA;This is the first of two novels featuring English horse-racing jockey Kit Fielding, with the second book being Bolt. One thing I do recall liking about Francis’ stories is the insights they provided into various professions&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Books: The Illegals I recently finished reading The Illegals: Russia’s Most Audacious Spies and Their Century-Long Mission to Infiltrate the West by Shaun Walker.&#xA;Walker covers the history — from the Bolshevik revolution into the 21st century — of Russia’s program of training and deploying spies that immigrate to a country under a false identity, often residing there for years or even decades. They may gather intelligence regarding industrial or military capabilities.</description>

Sheriff Walt Longmire has been asked by a friend to investigate the disappearance of a mail carrier who failed to return from her 300-mile daily delivery route through southern Wyoming’s Red Desert&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Books: &amp;ldquo;The Woman in the Water&amp;rdquo; I recently finished reading The Woman in the Water by Charles Finch.&#xA;This is a prequel to the popular Charles Lenox mystery series, set in Victorian London. I had read the first in the series, A Beautiful Blue Death, a few years ago and enjoyed it.&#xA;The Woman in the Water is set many years earlier than other books in the series, in 1850. 23-year-old Charles Lenox has recently moved to London with his valet, Graham, with hopes of becoming a private detective.</description>

Most of the major characters from the first book return in this one, but while the first book revolved around Monsignor Hugh O&amp;rsquo;Flaherty, this book revolves more around another of O&amp;rsquo;Flaherty&amp;rsquo;s Escape Line cohorts (aka &amp;lsquo;The Choir&amp;rsquo;), Contessa Giovanna &amp;lsquo;Jo&amp;rsquo; Landini&amp;hellip;</description>

Miller.&#xA;Long time Baltimore Orioles’ manager Earl Weaver is best remembered as a feisty, larger-than-life (but smaller than most men) character, going literally toe-to-toe with MLB umpires in legendary rants that fans loved and journalists loved to write about.&#xA;But this chain-smoking, hard-drinking, foul-mouthed cartoon character was also a Baseball genius ahead of his time.</description>

Harkaway, an established novelist in his own right, is also the son of the late spy novelist John Le Carré.

      <description>Books: &amp;lsquo;The Why Is Everything: A Story of Football, Rivalry, and Revolution&amp;rsquo; by Michael Silver I just finished reading The Why Is Everything: A Story of Football, Rivalry, and Revolution by Michael Silver.&#xA;Silver is a sportswriter currently writing for The Athletic and has previously written for Sports Illustrated and the San Francisco Chronicle, among others.&#xA;In The Why Is Everything, Silver documents the rise of a young generation of NFL coaches, many of whom started or developed under long-time NFL head coach Mike Shanahan.</description>

      <description>Books: &amp;lsquo;Safe Houses&amp;rsquo; by Dan Fesperman In another post, I mentioned that most main characters in espionage stories are either professional spies or unwitting amateurs. That article highlighted the failed professionals of Mick Herron&amp;rsquo;s Slow Horses / Slough House series, who fall somewhat in between.&#xA;In Dan Fesperman&amp;rsquo;s Safe Houses, Helen Abell falls into this gap, as well, but from a different angle. Helen works on the fringe of the espionage business, managing safe houses for the CIA in 1979 Berlin.</description>

      <description>The Slow Horses of Slough House Many espionage stories&amp;rsquo; protagonists fall into one of two categories&amp;hellip;&#xA;The first category is the espionage professional: Ian Fleming&amp;rsquo;s James Bond, Daniel Silva&amp;rsquo;s Gabriel Allon, and John LeCarre&amp;rsquo;s George Smiley all come to mind. Cool, calm, collected, they are trained and paid to do their nation&amp;rsquo;s dirty work.&#xA;At the other end of the spectrum is the unwitting amateur that finds themselves thrust into a situation which they are seemingly ill-equipped to deal with.</description>

      <description>Books: &amp;lsquo;How We Got to Now: Six Innovations That Made the Modern World&amp;rsquo; by Steven Johnson I just finished reading How We Got to Now: Six Innovations That Made the Modern World by Steven Johnson, and I enjoyed it quite a bit.&#xA;Goodreads rates it at 4.11 and I would say that is about right, if you enjoy history and science.&#xA;Read more&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Books: &amp;lsquo;Bad Debts&amp;rsquo; by Peter Temple I first stumbled across Jack Irish on Acorn TV. It was (or should I say &amp;lsquo;is&amp;rsquo;, in today&amp;rsquo;s perpetual-life-via-streaming world?) an Australian TV series (and movies) starring Guy Pearce (LA Confidential, Memento, The King&amp;rsquo;s Speech). I enjoyed the TV series very much and recently sought out Peter Temple&amp;rsquo;s novels, on which the TV series is based.&#xA;Read more&amp;hellip;</description>
